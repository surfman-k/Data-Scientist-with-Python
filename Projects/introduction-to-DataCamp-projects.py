A Jupyter notebook is a document that contains text cells (what you're reading right now) and code cells. What is special with a notebook is that it's interactive: You can change or add code cells, and then run a cell by first selecting it and then clicking the run cell button above ( â–¶| Run ) or hitting ctrl + enter.
