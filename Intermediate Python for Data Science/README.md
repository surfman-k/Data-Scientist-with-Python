## Case Study

Scenario :  
We're walking up the Empire State Building and we're playing with a friend.
We throw a die 100 times. If it falls on 1 or 2, we go one step down. If it's 3,4, or 5, we go one step up.
If we get a 6, we throw it again and go up the corresponding amount of steps.
We cannot go lower than step 0. We also have a 0.1% chance of falling down the stairs when we make a move.
We bet that we will reach the 60th step. What are the odds that we will win this bet?

## Visualizations 

- 10 Random Walks with no clumsiness

- 250 Random Walks with a 0.1% chance of fall at each step

- Final step reached after 100 throws for 500 Random Walks. (Odds of reaching step 60 or above are 78.4%)
