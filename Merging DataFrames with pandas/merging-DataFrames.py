### Merging by column

# Merge revenue with managers on 'city': merge_by_city
merge_by_city = pd.merge(revenue, managers, on='city')

# Print merge_by_city
print(merge_by_city)

# Merge revenue with managers on 'branch_id': merge_by_id
merge_by_id = pd.merge(revenue, managers, on='branch_id')

# Print merge_by_id
print(merge_by_id)


### Merging on columns with non-matching labels

# Merge revenue & managers on 'city' & 'branch': combined
combined = pd.merge(revenue, managers, left_on='city', right_on='branch')

# Print combined
print(combined)
