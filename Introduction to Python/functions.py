# Functions

# Create variables var1 and var2
var1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
var2 = True

# Print out type of var1
print(type(var1))

# Print out length of var1
print(len(var1))

# Convert var2 to an integer: out2
out2 = int(var2)

# Create lists first and second
first = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0]
second = [10.75, 9.50]

# Paste together first and second: full
full = first + second

# Sort full in descending order: full_sorted
full_sorted = sorted(full, reverse=True)

# Print out full_sorted
print(full_sorted)

# Methods

# string to experiment with: place
place = "poolhouse"

# Use upper() on place: place_up
place_up = place.upper()

# Print out place and place_up
print(place, place_up)

# Print out the number of o's in place
print(place.count("o"))

# Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Print out the index of the element 20.0
print(areas.index(20.0))

# Print out how often 9.50 appears in areas
print(areas.count(9.50))
